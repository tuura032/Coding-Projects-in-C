# First-Coding-Projects

This repsitory represents my first ever forray into the world of coding, particularly my first month.
In these projects I worked on coding basics including learning my first language (C), practicing loops, conditional statements,
using arrays, sorting, searching, hash tables, linked lists, pointers, recursion, dynamic memory allocation, and basic file procedures.

These projects are mostly homework assignments from the course CS50. Descriptions are listed in order of completion, as each consecutive project demonstrates further understanding and complexity of C.

Mario (more/less) demonstrates loops and printing.

Credit implements a program that determines if the inputted credit card number is valid, and what type of card it is.

Vigenere encodes a message by a users inputted word-cipher.

Recover converts a raw data file of jpgs (in binary) and re-creates the .jpg files. 

Risize resizes a BMP file.

Dictionary implements a few functions used within Speller. Speller loads text from a file. Dictionary loads a dictionary into a hash table
and searches the dictionary for each word from speller to identify words that are spelled incorrectly. (I did not write speller, but it is included for context.)
