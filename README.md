# First-Coding-Projects

This repsitory represents my first ever forray into the world of coding, particularly my first month.
In these projects I worked on coding basics including learning my first language (C), practicing loops, conditional statements,
using arrays, sorting, searching, hash tables, linked lists, pointers, recursion, dynamic memory allocation, and basic file procedures.

These projects are mostly homework assignments from the course CS50.
